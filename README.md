## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and styling for the web pages, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic content, enhancing the user experience.
- **Bootstrap**: A responsive framework that helps create mobile-first web designs quickly and efficiently.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: A powerful JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side of the application, enabling real-time, scalable web applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, middleware management, and server setup.
